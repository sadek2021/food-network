                <p class="about-me">Hi! Welcome to my food network blog. I wanted to get more from our cookbooks and I
                    figured a lot of other people wanted to as well so I set up Eat Your Books. I'm a small,
                    privately owned company, staffed by dedicated people. I love what I do and I work at making every
                    visit our members make to an enjoyable one. </p>
